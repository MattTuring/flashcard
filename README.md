This is a CLI app that quizzes on the basics of JS.

## Setup

Clone down the forked repo (from your GitHub).

Once you have cloned the repo, change into the directory and install the library dependencies. Run:

```bash
npm install
```


Running `node index.js` will start the game, the index.js assumes you are using the name flashcard as your directory



When the game is functioning appropriately, you will be prompted for each question, have the opportunity to select an answer, and will be given feedback. You will be able to play through the entire deck of cards:
